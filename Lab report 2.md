## To do
- [ ] Process data table
	- [ ] Do relevant processing (averaging)
	- [ ] Calculate raw uncertainties 
	- [ ] Make the graph from it do MYP PROCESSING
	- [ ] Trendline - range and shit
	- [ ] Error bars possibly
- [ ] Processed uncertainty
	- [ ] Make uncertainty formula for the data processing
	- [ ] When you do the calculations, combine all the raw uncertainties
		- [ ] Ig u can figure it out.
- [ ] Regular conclusion shit
- [ ] Regular vlauation shit

### What are we doing

- Conclusion & evaluation
- Calculating friction coefficient

### Things to note when writing

Pull at constant speed - this means pulling force = friction force -> the sensor can measure it
- There is a small bump before flatten back

Expected result: $F_f$ proportional to mass (goes thru origin asw)

If value fits inside uncertainty - then somewhat accurate
- But if uncertainty range is large, then u need to evaluate. e.g. range is so large that not precise enough


**Conclusion Strand 2:** Comparison to scientific context – you compare to the EXPECTED result from general scientific community 
- **Compare** to online coefficient of friction of wood on wood

**Evaluation strand 1**
- U have to explain how the error impacted your result
	- Eg you pulled at an angle, you pull greater force for less horizontal force because sin < 1\
		- U need to explain this one VERY well. because everyone will. 
- Systematic vs random error
	- Strong trend but doesn't pass thru origin vs. Weak trend but does pass
	- Systematic error --> likely to have less errors
	- Random error --> u need to have more random evaluation errors
	- If u have large spread of data, your evaluation must explain that
	- If you have systematic error, your evaluation must explain also
- Explain whether your evaluation problem has a systematic or random problem

**Evaluation strand 2**
- Needs to be very specific, not just do this, but HOW u do this, and how specifically that changes
	- its like debate

**Eval points**
- Kind of guessing where selection of data occurs
	- Because you start pulling, you pull hard at first, then manually aim for equilibrium - increase and decrease depending on how u feel
	- When looking at data --> don't know WHERE equilibrium was reached
	- Impli: selecting region causes random error because you can never judge correctly
		- Important because I usually choose where to select based on how much it deviates from straight line

### Conclusion useful things 

**Data Processing**
#### $F_f = {\mu}{R}={\mu}{mg}$

$F_f$  = friction force
${\mu}$  = friction coefficient
$R$ = normal force



From unmoving, you apply force to move the mass some x distance

You increase force then you decrease a bit to match the dynamic friction force


50 each
261.42g ±0.01g block
100g ± 0.01g  increments (because you put it on the same scale)

CVs:
- Keep the sensor in air

### Evaluation

Sensor moves up and down 
- Longer string the angle becomes less significant
- Keeping on the board is bad idea because you introduce a second friction coefficient
